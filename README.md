# Infinite Borehole Field
The infinite borehole field is a theoretical construct which can be used to estimate the shallow geothermal potential and resource size assuming a borehole field that is infinitely large.
This code forms the basis for the calculations done for a paper published in Renewable Energy by Kimmo Korhonen of the Geological Survey of Finland and Abel Marko of the Eötvös Lorand University, et al.
