# Infinite Borehole Field
The infinite borehole field is a theoretical construct which can be used to estimate the shallow geothermal potential and resource size assuming a borehole field that is infinitely large.
This code forms the basis of the calculations done for a manuscript submitted to Renewable Energy by Kimmo Korhonen of the Geological Survey of Finland and Abel Marko of the Eötvös Lorand University.
