# Infinite Borehole Field Model
The infinite borehole field is a theoretical construct which can be used to estimate the shallow geothermal potential and resource size assuming a borehole field that is infinitely large.
This code forms the basis for calculations done for an upcoming paper by Kimmo Korhonen of the Geological Survey of Finland and Abel Marko of the Eötvös Lorand University.
